Working as a teacher of English brought up responsibility and high adaptability within me. The success of my work can be measured in my former and current students having moved to other countries or/and entered the desired universities. 

As a an old-school blogger, I used to have an account at diary.ru where I discovered the magic of the basics of CSS. My Python path was short but very engaging: I enrolled with a Belarushian school for kids [Айтигенио](https://itgen.io). I also remember myself trying html a long and distant time ago -- such that it may as well have been in a galaxy far-far away.  

The education section will make it pretty clear that my life it tightly connected to music. These days, I am streaming improvisations at Twitch and sometimes participate in various projects.  

I play video games, love hiking, I started painting with oil and acrylic this October. For sheer joy of nuerolinks spiking in my braing and thus filling me with joy, in November, I started studying German.  

Overall, I consider myself a passionate and adventurous person. With this course, hope to discover a whole new world of frontend development.

### Exes and Ohs
_Check to see if a string has the same amount of 'x's and 'o's. The method must return a boolean and be case insensitive.  
The string can contain any char._  

    function XO(s) {
      
      var str = s.toLowerCase()
      var o = 0
      var x = 0
      var hui = 0
      
      for (var i = 0; i < str.length; i++) {
        
        if (str[i] == 'o') {
          o++
        } else if (str[i] == 'x') {
          x++
        } else {
          hui++
        }
      }
      
      if (o == x) {
